For a LaTeX letter
1. Duplicate the letter.
2. For the original, set 2D, set fill both, and add the material.
3. For the duplicate:
	- Set 3D. 
	- Geometry -> Offset: -0.000001 m (tweak this).
	- Bevel -> Round -> Depth: 0.000003 m (tweak).
	- Potentially, change the resolution of the bevel.
	- Add the material.

For both curves:
Resolution Preview U: 64
Render.U: 0 (uses the same as preview).
If this causes problems, set the preview lower and the render to 64.

- Set the two materials (either create them from scratch or import from a .blend-file with resources.
- Set the keyframe depending on time.
