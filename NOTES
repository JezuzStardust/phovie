SVGLoader

Perhaps we should replace it with a function? 
Somehow, we must have return values so that we can get all points into the corresponding phobject. 

The function can take one argument (the file) and return the corresponding phobject(s). 

E.g. an svg-square will result in a Square(Phobject). 

We must also take care so that the objects can be stored in each other. 


Simplest case: 
One SVG with a square. 

We should have 

Square(Phobject) 

Instance variable: 
	position (x,y) - position of anchor
	length, width 
	anchor_position 
	rounded corners (data about these)
	rotation data? 
	all curves 

	Alternatively, we should just get the points with all the information
	already stored, but this will make it harder. 
	E.g. morphing between different corner radii can cause problems. 

	When parsing the SVG-file we can hence take the values and parse
	them all the way to Blender space. 
	These values can then be returned to Square.
