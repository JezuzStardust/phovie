# How do we store points?

# We should never have any smooth handles, but always free.

# Each point should be:

# point = np.array([cx, cHL, cHR, cy]) or some other smart order.

# A curve can then be

# curve = np.array([point1, point2, ...])

# We also need to keep track if the curve is filled or not.
