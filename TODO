SVG-import
There is a problem with importing svg-files created from dvisvgm. 
They are not automatically arranged in a suitable order. 

There are some possible workarounds:
	- Create your own importer of svg-files. This would be the 
	  safest way, but it also requires most work. 
	- Use dvisvgm but determine which letter is which by looking into
      the coordinates of the curve. 
	- Use pdf2svg: This seems to put the objects in the right order. 
	  However, this program does not outline the strokes (instead it
	  uses stroke thickness for e.g. the overbar of sqrt). So, in this
	  case, we should consider using inkscape to convert all objects to
      paths. This might not be future safe because the uncertainty of
      pdf2svg and inkscape functionality which may both change. 



Problems to solve:
- When adding an object with a name that is already taken, Blender adds .001, .002, etc to the object name. We must somehow catch this so that we can keep a reference to the correct object.
